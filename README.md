This is a super-basic-html website that shows you how to interact with the Mercadolibre API.

The idea of this example is that you have some code to copy&paste in order that you can have you application running in production as fast as possible :)

Everithing was done with JSP, Servlets and no frameworks. Only plain java. It's ready to be hosted in Google AppEngine.

Enjoy it.
